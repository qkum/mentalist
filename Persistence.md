# Saving Chains

Mentalist is able to save chain files for future use. To save a chain file, go to `Load/Save`&rightarrow;`Save Chain`, which will then prompt you where you'd like to save the file. For organization, saved Mentalist chains should have the extension `.mentalist`, which is enforced in the application on _most_ OSes.

# Loading Chains

Mentalist is able to load chain files by clicking on `Load/Save`&rightarrow;`Load Chain`. If the chain file refers to a user-specified file that is not present on the current system, Mentalist will put a red box around that file attribute and will prevent processing. To fix this, click on the `Fix...` button next to the file and specify a local file in its place.
